While working at Advanced Micro Devices, a few colleagues of mine would
sometimes post little programming puzzles to solve for fun.  Mostly the
kind of thing you would see on leetcode, 4clojure, etc.  (We sometimes
shamelessly poached problems from these sites as well.)

This is just a collection of some of these puzzles and their solutions.
